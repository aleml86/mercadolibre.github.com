When you first register in MercadoLibre you are immediately able to buy items, but if you want to sell items depending on the country you are on some extra information may be needed. If you try to list an item via API without completing this information you will receive an error. To avoid this step and the annoyance of looking up what the error means We recommend to start a selling flow through the site up to the step where the extra information is required.


- **1. Login/Register:** Start by registering/logging-in


- **2. Start list flow:** Click on the sell button on the home page

- **3. Complete the form:** The first time you start selling you should get a form like this. Fill and confirm the form and now you are ready to list items through the site or through APIs<br>
