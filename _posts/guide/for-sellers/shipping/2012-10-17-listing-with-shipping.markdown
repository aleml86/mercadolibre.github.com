## Overview

This guide explains how to deal with all the aspects of our API to successfully list and manage items with trackable shipment methods called *"MercadoEnvios"*.

The guide covers the different concepts within shipping and explains in detail the API resources involved:

- -shipping modes
- -items
- -shipping methods
- -shipping services

<br/>

It introduces the concepts of **shipping modes** and **shipping methods**, to later explain how to **list items with shipping methods** and **dimensions**.

Finally sellers can offer to their buyers the **free shipping** option using one of the available methods to improve the shipping experience.

## Shipping modes {#shipping-modes}


### Non-trackable shipments

**not_specified:** The listing does not have any kind of shipping option.<br/>

**custom:** Sellers provide a list of up to 10 shipping costs for buyers to pay. This option does not offer trackable shipping to the buyers.<br/>

*NOTE*: **These modes are not covered in this guide.**


### Trackable shipments

**ME1 mode**

Sellers list items with its own dimensions and the shipping cost will be calculated using these dimensions.

In this mode, the seller is responsible for completing the shipping process, he collects the money from the buyer, prints the label and provides the buyer with the tracking number. 
Typically large sellers with their own contract with shipping companies use this mode.<br/>


**ME2 mode**

Sellers do not include dimensions in their listings. Shipment costs are calculated using standard dimensions for each category.
The shipping is paid and handled by *MercadoLibre*.

Sellers are repsonsible for dropping the package to the mail.<br/>



**Which mode are you?**

Sellers are assigned shipping modes 'me1' or 'me2' by an agreement with ML. This mode cannot be changed by the seller.



## Item Dimensions {#dimensions}

Dimensions are used to calculate shipping cost and it's of a fixed format. If any measure is missing it is considered invalid format.

Length, width and height are separated by 'x' and ',' separates the weight.

Dimensions should represent the dimension of the package that will be shipped.

**10x20x50,3000** is a valid dimension string

**20x44x,3000** it's an invalid dimension string


<center>(length cm)x(width cm)x(height cm),(weight gr)</center><br /><br />

## Working with shipping mode me1
In 'me1' mode the seller provides the dimensions, the first to do is query the shipping_modes resource to obtain the shipping modes allowed for that category and the given dimensions.
