You can modify an item field after it has been listed using our API.

<pre class="terminal">
 https://api.mercadolibre.com/items/ITEM_ID
</pre>


You can modify the values for pictures, title, available quantity, price, attributes, etc. 

<strong>NOTE on descriptions:</strong>For our rules to protect buyers descriptions cannot be modified when the item has sales.

To modify a property, send a PUT request to the following URL:

You must send a JSON formatted body with the elements you wish to modify.

Example:
<pre class="terminal">
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Accept: application/json" -d
{ 
  "title": "Your new title",
  "price": 1000
}
https://api.mercadolibre.com/items/ITEM_ID?access_token=YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN
</pre>

Note: the JSON sent must not contain the Item ID.

If your item has been successfully modified, you will receive a "200 OK" response status. Keep in mind that it can take some time until you see the itemâ€™s information refreshed.

To add a new description, send a POST request to the following URL:

<pre class="terminal">

{% highlight javascript %}
{
